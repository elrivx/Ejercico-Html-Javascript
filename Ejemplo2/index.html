      <h1>Javascript Basics</h1>

      <p>
        JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
        JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small
        and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to
        take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a
        host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to
        the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over
        them.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="aqua">Declaration JavaScript</span> variables are
          containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with
          coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All
          JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These
          unique names are called identifiers.
          <span class="purple">var x;</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="aqua">Variable Assignment</span> operators assign values
          to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it,
          giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns
          a value to a variable. <span class="purple">var x= 10;</span>
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="aqua">Data types</span> are an important concept; to be
          able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are
          six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean, -
          <span class="purple">true</span> or
          <span class="purple">false;</span> null -
          <span class="purple">null</span> aka nothing; Number
          <span class="purple">-42</span> or
          <span class="purple">3.14159;</span> String -
          <span class="purple">"Coding Dojo Rocks!;</span>" Array -
          <span class="purple">[1,'Coding',2,'Dojo']</span>; and Object -<span
            class="purple"
            >{first_name:'Jane',last_name:'Doe'}</span
          >
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="aqua">Conditionals</span> When you write code, you want
          to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting
          different code blocks based on values or conditionals that have been
          met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish
          this. There are the following conditional statements:
          <span class="purple">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this
          code in our code block; <span class="purple">else if</span> to specify
          a new condition to test, if the first condition is false;
          <span class="purple">else</span> we execute this block of code;
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="aqua">Loops</span> There are many different kinds of
          loops in every programming language, but essentially do the same
          thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you
          have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then
          you stop. That's a loop!
        </li>

        <li>
          <span class="aqua">Functions</span>Functions are an encapsulation of a
          code block. When we call our function this will run that code block.
          Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are
          putting together a desk from Ikea, we open the instruction manual and
          get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place
          the table right way up. Done! We finished out instructions. Sadly
          there a a ton more table to do so lets call our function over and over
          again.
        </li>
